# ![](/klvn.gif) Kelvin Shadewing

Rew! I'm Kelvin, a shadewing who makes pixel art and programs games, mainly using C++ and Squirrel, though I have some knowledge of C#, Java, JavaScript, and Game Maker.

I'm currently working on [Kyrodian Legends](https://gitub.com/kelvinshadewing/kyrodianlegends), an open source action platform game featuring much of my own graphics, as well as a variety of creative commons assets that have been modified to fit into the style of the game.

KL is being written in my custom SDL-based game engine, [Brux](https://github.com/kelvinshadewing/brux-gdk), an engine designed to write games in the [Squirrel scripting language](https://squirrel-lang.org). So basically, I'm writing a game about a squirrel in Squirrel! Brux continues its rodent theme by using [Chipmunk](https://chipmunk-physics.net/) as a built-in advanced physics engine.

If you'd like to collaborate with me on any of this, I'd like help with testing and porting Brux onto other platforms. The embedded functions are being written to match Game Maker's closely, so anyone coming from GM will be able to easily learn it.

Anyone looking to contact me may [email me](mailto:kelvin@shadewing.net) or find me on Discord as Kelvin#0465 or Telegram as @KelvinShadewing.
